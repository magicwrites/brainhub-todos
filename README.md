## Quick project overview

- built atop of [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- uses [redux](http://redux.js.org/) for state and user actions control
- codebase is a slightly modified (redux example)[https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos] 

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## development todo:

### Code perfection

- clean up html in components

### Features to consider

- some styles to make it pretty
- store the state of the application in a localstorage, and allow user to reset it
- introduce react-redux-routing if more complicated features are to be introduced
